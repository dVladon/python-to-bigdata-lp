    "#### Common warnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please, ensure that you call the right interpreter (python2 or python3). Do not write just \"python\" without the major version. There is no guarantee that any particular version of Python is set as the default one in the Grading system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One cell must contain only one programming language.\n",
    "E.g. if a cell contains Python code and you also want to call a bash-command (using “!”) in it, you should move the bash to another cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our IPython converter is an improved version of the standard converter Nbconvert and it can process most of Jupyter's magic commands correctly (e.g. it understands \"%%bash\" and executes the cell as a \"bash\"-script). However, we highly recommend to avoid magics wherever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints for the YARN tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please, use relative HDFS paths, i.e. dir1/file1 instead of /user/jovyan/dir1/file1. When you submit the code it will be executed on a real Hadoop cluster. For instance, user ‘jovyan’ may not exist there.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hadoop counters’ names should have only small latin letters. One exception: only the first letter of the name can be in upper case.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Hadoop logs the counter of stop words should be before the counter of total words. For doing this please take into account that the counters are printed in the lexicographical order."

    "Only the answer to your task should be printed in the output stream (__stdout__) in the last cell. There should be no more output in this stream. In order to get rid of garbage [junk lines] (e.g. created by `hdfs dfs -rm` or `yarn` commands) redirect the output to /dev/null.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please take into account that you must __not__ redirect __stderr__ to anywhere. Hadoop, Hive, and Spark print their logs to stderr and the Grading system also reads and analyses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During checking the code from the notebook, the system runs all notebook's cells and reads the output of only the last filled cell. It is clear that any exception should not be thrown in the running cells. If you decide to write some text in a cell, you should change the style of the cell to Markdown (Cell -> Cell type -> Markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Grader takes into account the output from the sample dataset you have in the notebook. Therefore, you have to \"Run All\" cells in the notebook before you send the ipynb solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The name of the notebook must contain only Roman letters, numbers and characters “-” or “_”. For example, Windows adds something like \" (2)\" (with the leading space) at the end of a filename if you try to download a file with the same name. This is a problem, because you will have a space character and curly braces \"(\" and \")\". "
