    "Create your own database and 'use' it. Create external table `posts_sample_external` over the sample dataset with posts in `/data/stackexchange1000` directory. Create managed table `posts_sample` and populate with the data from the external table. The `posts_sample` table should be partitioned by year and by month of post creation. Provide output of query which selects lines number per each partition in the format:\n",
